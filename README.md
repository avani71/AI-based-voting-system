# AI Voting Advisor

This repository contains a simple AI-based voting advisor smart contract written in Solidity. The contract provides voting advice based on the block timestamp.

## Features of AI-Based Voting System
- **Automated Voting Advice:** The contract offers voting suggestions based on predefined logic.
- **Decentralized Deployment:** The contract is deployed on the Edu Chain for transparency and accessibility.
- **No User Input Required:** The contract does not require user input or configurations at deployment.
- **Immutable Advice:** Once deployed, the logic remains unchanged, ensuring trust in the decision-making process.

## Smart Contract
The contract is deployed at the following address on Edu Chain:

**Deployed Address:** `0x02Be43282d1F5f840Edf0577659Dd3AFe81c60c7`

## How It Works
- Call the `getVotingAdvice` function to receive a voting recommendation.
- The contract evaluates the block timestamp to determine if the advice should be "Vote YES" or "Vote NO."

## Usage
To interact with the contract, you can use a blockchain explorer, a web3-enabled wallet, or a smart contract interaction tool such as Remix or Etherscan.
